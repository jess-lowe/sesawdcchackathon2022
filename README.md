For this hackathon the theme was "Make boring things fun"
As students, naturally we find watching lectures online very boring and not very rewarding. 
To solve this problem, we have incentivised watching lectures by providing students a little ScreenBean friend as an extension on Chrome. 
By watching lectures, you gain points. After different point values, you unlock new customisations for your bean friend. 

You can also change the colour of your bean to your favourite colour. you do you boo. 

Why beans you ask?
Simple - beans are boring, but you get to make them fun!
